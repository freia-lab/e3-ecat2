Bullet‑proof configurator/diagnostic (multi‑slave, validations, offsets)
ecat_cfgdiag.c
======================
What this tool does:

Programs PDOs for each slave:
SM2 → size_bytes 8‑bit entries at entry_index (e.g., 0x7000)
SM3 → same (e.g., 0x6000)
Builds one domain and registers every entry across all slaves
Prints offset/bit per entry (byte‑packed; all 8‑bit), total domain size,
and runs unit‑test checks:

bit position must be 0 for each byte entry
offsets must be contiguous and start at 0
domain size must equal number of entries (296 for 62+234)

If anything is off (e.g., JSON sizes wrong), the tool fails fast with
a clear message.

=======================
Unit test mode
The validations printed at the end act as a basic unit test for mapping.
If you want a “pure test” run without printing offsets, you can
add --sleep 0 or pipe to less. The test will fail if layout doesn’t
match what we expect for 8‑bit entries.

=======================
Run instructions
sudo ./ecat_cfgdiag ./ecat_pdo_config.json --sleep 3
